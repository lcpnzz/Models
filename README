UFO model for single, double and triple Higgs production with modified SM couplings at hadron colliders 
using the deconstruction method in Ref. https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03003

The coupling orders associated to *additive* modifications to SM couplings are:

HHH -> trilinear Higgs coupling
HHHH -> quadrilinear Higgs coupling
HTTMOD -> Higgs-top Yukawa coupling
HBBMOD -> Higgs-bottom Yukawa coupling
